# Natural Language Processing

This is the repository of the project proposed for the course of *Natural Language Processing*. 

It contains two large homeworks written in Python:
1. **Homework 1:** Word-in-Context Disambiguation;
2. **Homework 2:** Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis.

The general overview of the solution of each of them can be found in a [**merged presentation**](https://github.com/olga-sorokoletova/NLP/blob/main/Presentation%20for%20both%20Homeworks.pdf).

## Homework 1

### Detailed Description of the Task Assignment:

[Task Assignment for NLP 2021 - Homework 1](https://github.com/olga-sorokoletova/NLP/blob/main/Homework%201/Task%20Assignment%20for%20NLP%202021%20-%20Homework%201.pdf)

### Detailed Report on the Solution Approaches and Results:

[Report for NLP 2021 - Homework 1](https://github.com/olga-sorokoletova/NLP/blob/main/Homework%201/report.pdf)

### Execution:

Two alternatives ways are provided:
* can be run and tested through the docker as described in the README.md of Homework 1 (all the folders are populated with necessary files),
* or as a set of Jupyter Notebooks which are stored in [stud](https://github.com/olga-sorokoletova/NLP/tree/main/Homework%201/hw1/stud) folder (pay attention that then [```data```](https://github.com/olga-sorokoletova/NLP/tree/main/Homework%201/data), [```embeddings```](https://github.com/olga-sorokoletova/NLP/blob/main/Homework%201/model/glove.6B.50d.txt) and, if it is desired to use models as freezed or pre-trained - [```weights```](https://github.com/olga-sorokoletova/NLP/tree/main/Homework%201/model), must be loaded into notebook).

## Homework 2

### Detailed Description of the Task Assignment:

[Task Assignment for NLP 2021 - Homework 2](https://github.com/olga-sorokoletova/NLP/blob/main/Homework%202/Task%20Assignment%20for%20NLP%202021%20-%20Homework%202.pdf)

### Detailed Report on the Solution Approaches and Results:

[Report for NLP 2021 - Homework 2](https://github.com/olga-sorokoletova/NLP/blob/main/Homework%202/report.pdf)

### Execution

In general, two alternatives ways are provided, similarly to Homework 1:
* can be run and tested through the docker as described in the README.md of Homework 2,
* or as a set of Jupyter Notebooks which are stored in [stud](https://github.com/olga-sorokoletova/NLP/tree/main/Homework%202/hw2/stud) folder ([```data```](https://github.com/olga-sorokoletova/NLP/tree/main/Homework%202/data)),

BUT to run using the first way, first the folder named **model** with weights of the models in a ```.pt``` format must be added to the repository (haven't been uploaded due to the high memory consumption).
